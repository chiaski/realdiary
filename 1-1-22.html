    1.1.2022 - guys, i’m currently writing a play in the woods in a notebook. its 12:47 a.m. and i’ve been sitting here for almost 3 hours. i’m thinking it would make a good story so i can sell it. i’ve probably lost 5 years of productivity and i’ve put all of this time into this idea that should have taken me 5 minutes. it should be easy but i don’t feel satisfied with this at all. so this will probably turn into a story. but i’m too dazed to figure out where to go next. now i want to have the plot line set out before me for 2 hours so i can know exactly how to structure it, which characters to include, which themes to include, how the characters are structured. i’m almost hoping that this goes on and on. like, if it’s going to end the right way, it should probably have taken about 7 hours. i should have gone to bed at like 9:30.
