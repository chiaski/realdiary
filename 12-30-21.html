    <p>* hipster villains that don’t have evil motives but just like to show they are villains  or just like to show they are cool bad guys<br><br>

* sense of entitlement and entitlement that is justified — a saying i have is that the condition of the victor is that he know he is a victor<br><br>

* no bottom — the idea of creating a job where you take food from the mouths of the poor<br><br>

* dinner table equality — that rich and poor sit together and eat<br><br>

* irony — isn’t that the way comedy works?? people can see the situation as ironic and then use that to start thinking or speaking about an issue<br><br>

* lets say a farmer has started a non-hippie agricultural project. what is the best way to screw it up? make some haphazard attempts to increase production through force, bribery, backhand deals, etc. or if you are the government: cut the aid to this particular program, double the rate of taxation on farmers (note: why do we tax farmers so much?), try to convince the farmers not to work with the non-government farming project and set up your own, which would likely be the worst farming project ever made, have your agents bribe all the farmers, etc<br><br>

* the american dream of owning your own home, going to college, paying off a mortgage (cant help but thinking of josiah 21:1) — is that what all these people want
