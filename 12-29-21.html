      * At some point in human development, we start to see things as connected<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* (actually a line to that!) “loosely connected” can be really frustrating for someone who is *really* “loosely connected” to other things, like a person who would see that tree as part of the earth and think that he was disconnected from the earth<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* “loosely connected” is the idea that “theoretically” (and “effectively”) everything can be connected (that could also be seen as the phrase “misunderstanding”)<br><br>

* thing you need to know about the psyche is that any one thing—like the home I am living in right now or the person who just walked in — is a work in progress<br><br>

* I didn’t think I would say this but… i felt really stupid. a little disappointed in myself but more in this intangible entity called “life”<br><br>

* too much of life is not what I want it to be<br><br>

* I have to face some tough questions: what is the purpose of life? what is the purpose of a choice? how do I get from this place to that place, where is this all heading?<br><br>

* the war on drugs<br><br>

* Is nothing sacred? <br><br>

* Is it appropriate to have children?<br>

* i think about how when i was younger (really young) in reference to asking a girl out i had no idea how to ask. i didn’t know if she was interested in me or if she would just say yes and then make me sleep with her<br>

* what if I’m getting married and I don’t love her? i guess i shouldn’t marry anyone if i don’t love them but I can see myself married to someone just because that’s how the world works<br><br>

* I don’t remember what i’ve wrote
