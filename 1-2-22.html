    <p>* i love collage class<br>

* every time we get a new piece of paper, it looks like its been burned<br>

* i got a new little buddy on my desk. her name is puppy paw<br>

* i just sang this song with u.<br>

* i think i’m beginning to see the types of people who i’m drawn to<br>

* the object was to write the most thrilling and important description of someone<br>

* to imagine a person doing the most uninteresting and mundane things, like washing their hands or watching tv.<br>

* this may be one of the most confusing things i’ve ever done. i think we are attracted to people who have the same interests as ourselves<br>

* i am never bored when talking to u and our conversations are never dull<br>

* my point of view is often so jumbled when i’m with u that i often find myself laughing without even knowing why.<br>

* what is the difference between a crush and love?<br>

* the more i write, the more i discover<br>

* g i love u<br>

* i’ve written down the details of 2 stories, both of which are a shit load of word vomit. it’s best if i don’t share them, at least for a while.<br>

* i don’t know what i’m doing, or why i’m doing it, but i’m so happy<br>

* a bunch of my favorite quotes are lies</p>
