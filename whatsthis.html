    <p>This is a `very real` diary by <a href="https://chia.design" target="_blank">Chia</a> featuring curated bits of my journal, note dumps, and diaries ran through a neural net. No entries here contain my original writing (they are merely generated from it).</p>
      
    <p>How much of our process of merely *thinking* and wondering is distorted by the internet when we choose to put material up? How much of ourselves becomes performance? Can something not kept private ever be a reflection of one's authentic self? It's up to you to discern how you view me based on these entries.</p>
      
      <p>If you want to read the raw entries with ease, you can view the source or look through <a href="https://github.com/chiaski/realdiary" target="_blank">the Github repository.</a></p>

      <p>I have an actual blog where I do overshare at <a href="https://chias.blog" target="_blank">chias.blog</a>. The content used to generate these entries is different from my blog entries.</p>
